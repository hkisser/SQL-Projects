# SQL-Projects
Have a peak into my SQL life :eyes:

I'm delighted to have you here,I'm Hillary

Some things to keep in mind while you read

1. This branch, the main branch, is your road map for navigating my projects.

2. The other branches house my other SQL projects, therefore the name of each branch basically represents the name of the project.

3. Click on the downpointing arrow beside "main" at the top left underneath the "Issue" and "Pull Request" Tabs to have a look at my other projects

That's all for now, see you later :wink:
